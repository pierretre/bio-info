Bio-informatics project made during studies (2022).

First part : Genome assembler
  -> Naive assembler made from scratch
  -> De Bruijn Graph based assembler 
  
  All coded in python
  
  
Second part : Clustering
  -> Needleman-Wunch Algorithm implementation for protein nucleotides alignment
  -> Divise and Agglomerative clusterings to produce a Newick format cluster tree
  
  In java
